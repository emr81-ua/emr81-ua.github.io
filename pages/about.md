# Eric – Computer engineer

Aspiring gameplay programmer with a background in Computer Engineering, specialized in hardware systems. I started making small games and prototypes as personal projects, and over time, this hobby grew into a serious passion. Now, I'm working towards entering the game industry professionally.

I have a strong interest in both artificial intelligence and hardware-driven systems, and I love bringing technical ideas to life through gameplay mechanics and interactive experiences.
