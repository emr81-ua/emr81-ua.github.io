# Eric â€“ Computer engineer

Aspiring gameplay programmer with a background in Computer Engineering, specialized in hardware systems. I began making small games and prototypes as personal projects, and over time, this hobby turned into a deep passion and career goal.

While I focus on gameplay and systems programming, Iâ€™m passionate about learning all areas involved in game developmentâ€”AI, graphics, UI, audio, networking, and more. I enjoy understanding how every part fits together and love solving technical challenges to bring ideas to life.
