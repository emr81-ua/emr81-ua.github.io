# Eric â€“ Computer engineer

Aspiring gameplay programmer with a background in Computer Engineering, specialized in hardware systems. I started creating small games and prototypes as personal projects, and over time, this hobby evolved into a true passion. Now, Iâ€™m fully focused on joining the game industry professionally.

While my main focus is gameplay programming and systems design, I consider myself a generalist developerâ€”capable of contributing across the entire development pipeline. I enjoy learning about all the disciplines involved in making games, and I strive to understand how each area connects to deliver a cohesive and engaging experience.

From core gameplay and AI systems, to graphics, audio, UI/UX, networking, physics, and engine architectureâ€”Iâ€™m constantly expanding my knowledge and toolkit. I believe that being curious and flexible is essential to building great games, and Iâ€™m always eager to dive into new challenges, learn fast, and grow with every project
