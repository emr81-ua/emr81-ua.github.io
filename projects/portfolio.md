title: 'Personal Portfolio'

This personal **Portfolio** is a showcase of my ongoing journey as a game developer and programmer. Here youâ€™ll find a collection of my projects, prototypes, and experiments across various areas like AI, graphics, and gameplay systems.

Itâ€™s designed as a central hub to keep track of everything Iâ€™m working on â€” from small coding challenges to larger-scale experiments in game development.

### Portfolio Contents

This portfolio will serve as a **living record** of my work, including:

- Prototypes and demos exploring unique gameplay mechanics
- AI experiments and implementations of board games
- Graphics and rendering tests using libraries like **SFML**, **SDL2**, and **OpenGL**
- Custom tools, utilities, and code snippets to support development
- Experiments in game engines and physics-based systems

Iâ€™ll keep updating this space as I learn and build new things.
