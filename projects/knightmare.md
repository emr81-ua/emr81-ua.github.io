title: 'Knightmare'

**Knightmare** is a personal action game prototype where you play as a cursed knight navigating a hostile dream world.

The project focuses on physics-driven sword combat controlled entirely by mouse gestures â€” the speed and direction of your swing determine the damage and knockback applied.

### ðŸ”¨ Key Features & Systems

- Character movement with **WASD**, and a **dash mechanic** (Space Bar) with brief invincibility frames
- **Real-time weapon control** with the mouse; swing strength depends on gesture velocity
- **Enemy wave generation** using a custom **spawner system**
- Multiple **enemy types** and **weapons** exist, though only one of each is featured in the current build
- Still in development â€” focused on prototyping core mechanics
